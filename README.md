# About

This repository contains configuration files I use on Mac and Linux systems, inspired by the "dotfiles" movement. There's a `.gitignore` because I want to keep track of files in my home directory. If you're avoiding symlinks or have a similar setup, setting `git config status.showUntrackedFiles no` will give you control. Some day I'll move to one of the better setups mentioned [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11070797).

I'll be storing cheatsheets and whatnots under [`.docs/`](.docs) because I just can't get other note-taking methods to work.

## Usage
