# About

This repository contains configuration files I use on Mac and Linux systems, inspired by the "dotfiles" movement. This is a `.gitignore` because I prefer to keep track of files in my home directory. If you're also avoiding symlinks or wondering how this can be mangeable, setting `git config status.showUntrackedFiles no` should give enough control. Otherwise, I'd suggest you adopt one of the better setups mentioned [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11070797).

I will also try to keep cheatsheets and whatnots under [`.docs/`](.docs) for future reference.
